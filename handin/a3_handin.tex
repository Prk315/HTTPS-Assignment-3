\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
% Brief overview of what you implemented
% E.g., "This report describes the implementation of the k-nearest-neighbour
% algorithm using both brute-force and k-d tree approaches..."


\section{Implementation Details}
% Comment on interesting details of your implementation
% Do NOT give a line-by-line walkthrough
% Focus on algorithmic choices, data structures, optimizations, etc.

\subsection{Brute-force k-NN}
% Describe interesting aspects of your brute-force implementation


\subsection{k-d Tree Construction and Querying}
% Describe interesting aspects of your k-d tree implementation


\section{Performance Analysis}

\subsection{Expected Performance}
% What did you expect? Discuss theoretical complexity


\subsection{Observed Performance}
% What did you observe? Include timing results, benchmarks
% Demonstrate at least one workload where brute-force is fastest,
% and one where the k-d tree is fastest


\subsection{Explanation of Results}
% Explain any discrepancy between expected and observed performance


\section{Correctness and Testing}

\subsection{Testing Methodology}
% Describe how you tested your implementation
% E.g., visual inspection with knn-svg, comparison between implementations, etc.


\subsection{Functional Correctness}
% Do you think it is functionally correct? Why or why not?


\section{Quality and Reliability}

\subsection{Memory Management}
% Do you think it leaks memory or other resources? Why or why not?
% Did you use valgrind or similar tools?


\subsection{Known Limitations}
% Any bugs or issues you're aware of?


\section{Potential Improvements}
% Is there some improvement you'd have liked to make, but didn't have the time?


\section{Conclusion}
% Brief summary of your work and reflections
